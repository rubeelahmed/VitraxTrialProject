## Clone Steps

1. To begin, sign in to your user account on GitHub.
2. In the upper right corner, click the + sign icon, then choose New repository. 
3. This will take you to a page where you can enter a repository name. 
4. From your repository page on GitHub, click the green button labeled Clone or download, and in the “Clone with HTTPs” section, copy the URL for your repository.
5. Next, on your local machine, open your bash shell and change your current working directory to the location where you would like to clone your repository.
6. Note that here we are using a bash command - cd (change directory).

For example, if you wanted to have your repository in your Documents folder, you change directories as follows:
* cd Documents

Once you have navigated to the directory where you want to put your repository, you can use:
git clone https://github.com/URL-TO-REPO-HERE
The git clone command copies your repository from GitHub to your local computer. Note that this is a git specific command.
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY : rubeelahmed/VitraxTrialProject

Press Enter.
